# Exponential Growth Calculator
This fantastic little tool takes in a growth rate, starting value and cycle count and then performs a recersive loop to calculate the exponential growth of the parameters.
The resulting value is then output and a chart is generated to display the growth. 

PS: As a side note if you require more information as to what the exact numbers are at any one stage of the cycle you can simple view the Javascript console as the program
will output all cycle steps to it during the loop.
